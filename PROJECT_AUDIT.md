- No validation of functionality
- Cannot verify if features work as documented

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing:**
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Functionality validation
- Error scenario testing

### 7. Security & Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- No obvious security vulnerabilities in launcher code
- Proper input validation in menu system
- Safe file operations

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Areas for Improvement:**
- No authentication handling for Hugging Face API
- No environment variable usage for sensitive data
- No input sanitization for file operations

### 8. Performance & Scalability

#### ‚ùå **Cannot Assess:**
- Performance characteristics unknown due to missing implementation
- No benchmarks or performance metrics
- Scalability not tested

### 9. Deployment & Distribution

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Clear installation instructions
- Requirements file provided
- Launcher script for easy execution

#### ‚ùå **Issues:**
- Cannot be deployed or distributed due to missing functionality
- No packaging configuration (setup.py, pyproject.toml)

### 10. Maintainability & Future Development

#### ‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Well-documented code structure
- Modular design in launcher
- Clear separation of concerns

#### ‚ùå **Issues:**
