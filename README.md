# Rutgers University Social Media Dashboard

A modern, responsive dashboard for managing social media accounts at Rutgers University.

## Features

## Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. Accessibility Improvements
- Added `title` and `aria-label` attributes to all interactive elements
- Fixed missing accessible names for buttons and form controls
- Improved keyboard navigation and focus indicators

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added proper CSP meta tag to allow necessary resources
- Configured to allow inline scripts, external CDNs, and data URIs
- Prevents XSS attacks while maintaining functionality

### 3. Resource Loading Issues
- Replaced external placeholder images with embedded SVG data URIs
- Added error handling for Chart.js loading failures
- Improved fallback content when resources fail to load

### 4. External Link Security
- Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to all external links
- Prevents potential security vulnerabilities from external sites

### 5. Code Organization
- Moved inline styles to external CSS file (`style.css`)
- Improved maintainability and performance
- Better separation of concerns

### 6. Error Handling
- Added try-catch blocks around Chart.js initialization
- Graceful degradation when external resources fail
- Console warnings for debugging

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Notes

- Uses Tailwind CSS CDN (not recommended for production)
- Consider installing Tailwind locally for production use
- Chart.js is loaded from CDN with fallback handling

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Setup and Build

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build for development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   # or
   ./build.sh prod
   ```

4. **Open the dashboard:**
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser
   - For local development, you can use a simple HTTP server:
     ```bash
     npx serve .
     # or
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```

### Build Process
- Tailwind CSS is compiled from `src/input.css` to `dist/styles.css`
- JavaScript is externalized to `static/js/main.js`
- CSP-compliant with nonce-based script loading
- Production builds are minified and optimized
