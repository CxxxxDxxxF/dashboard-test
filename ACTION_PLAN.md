- [ ] Add dataset loading from Hugging Face
- [ ] Add data processing and filtering
- [ ] Add visualization capabilities
- [ ] Add model evaluation features

**Deliverable:** Fully functional demo script

### 2. **Fix Launcher Dependencies** ⚡
**Timeline:** 1 hour  
**Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Update `run_demo.py` import statements
- [ ] Fix function references
- [ ] Test launcher functionality
- [ ] Ensure all menu options work

**Deliverable:** Working launcher script

### 3. **Create Basic Test Suite** ⚡
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours  
**Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `tests/` directory
- [ ] Add unit tests for core functions
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Test dataset loading
- [ ] Test visualization features

**Deliverable:** Basic test coverage

### 4. **Generate Sample Output Files** ⚡
**Timeline:** 1 hour  
**Status:** ❌ Not Started

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create sample `dataset_analysis.md`
- [ ] Create sample `model_comparison_report.md`
- [ ] Generate sample visualization images
- [ ] Create sample web interface

**Deliverable:** All referenced files exist

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Day 1)
1. **Morning (4 hours):**
   - Implement dataset loading and basic processing
   - Create first 5 demo steps
   - Test basic functionality

2. **Afternoon (4 hours):**
   - Implement remaining 5 demo steps
   - Add visualization features
   - Fix launcher dependencies

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation (Day 2)
1. **Morning (3 hours):**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Test all features thoroughly
   - Fix any bugs found

2. **Afternoon (3 hours):**
   - Generate sample output files
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Final testing and validation

## 📊 Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] `python run_demo.py` works without errors
- [ ] All 10 demo steps execute successfully
- [ ] Web interface generates correctly
- [ ] All documented features work as described

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] No critical errors in execution
- [ ] All imports resolve correctly
- [ ] Generated files match documentation
- [ ] User experience is smooth and intuitive

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Code follows Python best practices
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Documentation matches implementation
- [ ] Tests pass successfully

## 🛠️ Required Resources

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Hugging Face account (for dataset access)
- Text editor/IDE

### External Dependencies
- Internet connection (for dataset download)
- Hugging Face API access
- matplotlib for visualizations

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Dataset Access Issues**
   - **Mitigation:** Use fallback sample data
   - **Backup:** Create mock dataset for testing

2. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - **Mitigation:** Use virtual environment
   - **Backup:** Document exact versions used

3. **Implementation Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Start with basic functionality
   - **Backup:** Focus on core features first

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Daily Check-ins
- **End of Day 1:** Core implementation complete
- **End of Day 2:** Testing and validation complete
- **Final Review:** All success criteria met

### Milestone Markers
- [ ] **Milestone 1:** Basic dataset loading works
- [ ] **Milestone 2:** All 10 steps implemented
- [ ] **Milestone 3:** Launcher fully functional
- [ ] **Milestone 4:** Tests passing
- **Final Milestone:** Project ready for use

## 🎯 Next Steps After Implementation

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **User Testing:** Have others test the demo
2. **Bug Fixes:** Address any issues found
3. **Documentation Updates:** Ensure accuracy

### Short-term (Week 2-3)
1. **Performance Optimization:** Improve speed and efficiency
2. **Additional Features:** Add advanced capabilities
3. **Security Enhancements:** Add authentication handling

### Long-term (Month 1-2)
1. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment
2. **Packaging:** Create distributable package
3. **Community:** Share and get feedback

## 📞 Support & Escalation
